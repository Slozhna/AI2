Generic problem solver capable of performing different types of searches.
Currently performs the following searches:

Breadth-first ('bfs')
A* Search ('asm' or 'aso' depending on heuristic) 

A* Search can use one of two heuristics:

Number Out of Place ('aso')
Manhattan Distance ('asm')

Example usage for asm with no debug:
	java -Xmx1024m ProblemSolver 5 6 8 4 0 1 2 3 7
